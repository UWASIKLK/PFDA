# PFDA - Programing for Data Analytics
***
This repository contains the program and analysis related to the problems set in the weekly tasks and labs, as well as my work and final project. 

### The learing outcomes of this module are:

* Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
* Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems.
* Create software that incorporates and utilises standard numerical libraries.
* Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications.

### Get Started

To get started with this project, you will need to download the necessary software/application in case you don't have it:

- **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)** - it is a platform which is used to share a code design for machine learning and data science. It is open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages. Modules required for this project are Pandas and Matplotlib.

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)** - it is integrated development environment (IDE) designed by Microsoft which can be used for writing, editing, debugging and building the code.

- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** - is cloud base platform which allows developers to store, manage and share their code. Git is open source and free to use control system which GitHub uses for small and large project to track any change you make in GitHub.

- **[Cmder](https://cmder.app/)** - Cmder is an open-source console emulator for Windows. Cmder comes as a preconfigured software bundle of the ConEmu terminal emulator and other third-party software that includes, Git for Windows, Clink, Clink-completions and PowerShell (Ps) Get module.

- **[GitHub Account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)** - to get started with GitHub, you'll need to create a free personal account and verify your email address.

If you want to explore my repositories, you can `clone` the selected repository to your device from my link: `git clone https://github.com/UWASIKLK/PFDA.git`. Alternatively, you can create `GitHub Codespases` in your existing GitHub account. Here's how: [GitHub Codespaces overview - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)


### Repository

* **My Work** - this directory contains my work during the course following the lectures videos and lab work.
* **Assignments** - this directory contains the practical assignments.
* **Project** - this directory contains the final project for this module.

### Assignments

* First assignement was to created the repository for this module and upload a link.

* **assignment2-weather** - this assignement was about to create a Jupyter Notebook that has a plot of the temperature over the time, using the data from _'dryBulbTemperature_Celsius'_ column.

* **assignment3-pie** - this task consisted of creating a Jupiter notebook that would contain a pie chart of people's email domains in a CSV file at that [URL](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download).

* **assignment5-risk** - in this assignment we should write a program (or Jupyther notebook) that will simulate 1,000 individual battle rounds in board game _Risk_ (with 3 attackers and 2 defenders) and plot the results. The one battle round is one shake of the attacker's and defender's dice. An additional task has been assigned to this assignment.

* **assignment6-weather** - in this assignment we should create python file or Jupyther notebook using data from this [URL](https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv) and plot the temperature, the mean temperature each day and the mean temereature for each month. An additional task has been assigned to this assignment.
