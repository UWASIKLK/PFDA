# PFDA - Programing for Data Analytics
***
This repository contains the program and analysis related to the problems set in the weekly tasks and labs, as well as my work and final project. 

### The learing outcomes of this module are:

* Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
* Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems.
* Create software that incorporates and utilises standard numerical libraries.
* Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications.

### Repository

* **My Work** - this directory contains my work during the course following the lectures videos and lab work.
* **Assignments** - this directory contains the practical assignments.
* **Project** - this directory contains the final project for this module.

### Assignments

* First assignement was to created the repository for this module and upload a link.

* **assignment2-weather** - this assignement was about to create a Jupyter Notebook that has a plot of the temperature over the time, using the data from _'dryBulbTemperature_Celsius'_ column.

* **assignment3-pie** - this task consisted of creating a Jupiter notebook that would contain a pie chart of people's email domains in a CSV file at that [URL](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download).

* **assignment5-risk** - in this assignment we should write a program (or Jupyther notebook) that will simulate 1,000 individual battle rounds in board game _Risk_ (with 3 attackers and 2 defenders) and plot the results. The one battle round is one shake of the attacker's and defender's dice. An additional task has been assigned to this assignment.

* **assignment6-weather** - in this assignment we should create python file or Jupyther notebook using data from this [URL](https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv) and plot the temperature, the mean temperature each day and the mean temereature for each month. An additional task has been assigned to this assignment.
